## What I learned

- Using the CSS `calc` function to calculate the size of each grid item.
- The logic behind generating a random number between min and max

  ```js
  Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;
  ```

## Challenges Faced

- Naming classes and structuring my CSS
- I still don't understand some weirds behaviors when trying to size Flexbox items.

## Future Improvements

- Make it fully responsive
- Better hover effects and adding transitions
- Applying a CSS convention to name classes and structure the CSS
